My name is Riccardo and I have been developing software since the age of 12. I love learning new things every single day, keeping up to date to always apply the best solutions to my works.

I have been working in Italy in the automotive software sector for over 10 years.🧑‍💻

In the last few years I have grown into and use Flutter a lot. I try to develop libraries to share my work and help improve or extend other people's libraries.
